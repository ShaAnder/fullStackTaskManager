A small Task manager application utilizing a flask base with sql for the backend and a materialize framework for the front end. 

The purpose of this app was to demonstrate knowledge of full stack technologies as part of my Diploma in full stack software development.

As this was originally a follow along project, I opted to take the same approach I usually do, try and learn / implement things differently
and often before the current implementation is being covered. Only following the lessons if i had exhausted all other options.

Technologies used:

HTML
CSS
JS
Materialize
Flask
SQLAlchemy

As this app uses an older version of sql alchemy to get it to run, when installing packages the following pip install command is
recommended

```
pip3 install 'Flask-SQLAlchemy<3' psycopg2 sqlalchemy==1.4.46
```
