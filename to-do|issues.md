To do list to finish task manager app:

- Build out readme
- Contact page
- Form Styling for adding of tasks
- code refactoring, lot of duplicate routes, look into refactoring based on what button was clicked?

Known bugs:

Css not populating on heroku
when deleting a category or task it keeps the user at the deletion url, instead of redirecting
